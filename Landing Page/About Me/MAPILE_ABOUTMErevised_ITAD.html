<h2>~<u><a id="childhood">Childhood Years</a></u>~</h2>
<p align="justify"><sub><b> Back when I was young, I lived in the province.<sup>1</sup>
<img src="KID DIEGO 1.png" class=imgl align="left" vspace=”100” vspace=”100”></img> 
It was calm and peaceful, and I was so happy living those days.<sup>2</sup>
All of my classmates are my friends, each and every single one of them.<sup>3</sup>
I became a top student in Preschool as I also enjoyed learning during those days in a school named Kiddibytes Learning Center.<sup>4</sup>
I received my first game device at that era.<sup>5</sup>
It was a Gameboy Advance SP gifted to me when I graduated.<sup>6</sup> 
Every day, I played around with my cousins with the old Filipino outdoor games.<sup>7</sup> 
Games such as “Langit lupa”, “Patintero”, and so much more.<sup>8</sup>
I also had the best “katulong” ever during those years.<sup>9</sup> 
<img src="KID DIEGO 2.png" class=imgr align="right" vspace=”100” vspace=”100”></img> 
She always knew what I wanted and she’s always there when I need her.<sup>10</sup> 
My mother and father are always at work during that time for them to support me until I graduate.<sup>11</sup>
That is why my parents left me with a “katulong” for me to have fun playing with whenever I felt lonely.<sup>12</sup> 
The time when we transferred to Quezon City, things were not the same.<sup>13</sup> 
It changed my personal and social life ever since.<sup>14</sup> 
We left our “katulong” at the province to serve both my grandfather and grandmother as they continue to live peacefully.<sup>15</sup>
I was enrolled in Siena College and during my years in early elementary, I struggled to become a top student.<sup>16</sup> 
It is like my passion for learning has vanquished.<sup>17</sup>
<img src="KID DIEGO 3.png" class=imgl align="left" vspace=”100” vspace=”100”></img>
But I am still determined to finish my studies no matter what.<sup>18</sup> 
I finished grades 1-3 in that school.<sup>19</sup>
My parents decided to move once again, this time in the city of Manila.<sup>20</sup> 
I transferred from one school to another named Bethel Knox.<sup>21</sup> 
I studied there for grade 4 and 5.<sup>22</sup> 
That school gave me amazing memories and friends, and I will consider it one of the best schools that I had ever enrolled in.<sup>23</sup></sup> 
As time passes by I transferred again to another school named Espiritu Santo Parochial School or ESPS in short.<sup>24</sup> 
That is where I studied in grade 6 and graduated elementary.<sup>25</sup> 
As time flies, I begin my teenage years in that school.<sup>26</sup></font>

<h2>~<u><a id="teenage">Teenage Years</a></u>~</h2>
<p align="justify"><sub><b>As a teenager, I grew interest in using computers.<sup>1</sup>
<img src="TEEN DIEGO 1.png" class=imgr align="right" vspace=”100” vspace=”100”></img>
I also used computers when I was still a kid, because my father is the one who introduced me to it.<sup>2</sup>
It was still a blur to what it is to me when I was still a child.<sup>3</sup>
But when I’m 13, I finally understand what computers can do to help me with my daily life.<sup>4</sup>
For years I used it for gaming, for entertainment and for school projects.<sup>5</sup>
It was literally the best thing that ever came to my entire life.<sup>6</sup>
During my years in ESPS, I’ve met new friends that have the same interests as me.<sup>7</sup>
<img src="TEEN DIEGO 2.png" class=imgl align="left" vspace=”100” vspace=”100”></img>
I also gained my very own cell phone at the beginning of my first year in high school.<sup>8</sup>
My life is balanced during those days.<sup>9</sup>
Taking it easy at the start and being stressful at the end of each quarter.<sup>10</sup>
It develops me into loving more of what technology can do to all of us in the future.<sup>11</sup>
During those years, I decided that I would like to study more about technology.<sup>12</sup>
I have learned the basics of what a computer is and about its parts.<sup>13</sup>
<img src="TEEN DIEGO 3.png" class=imgr align="right" vspace=”100” vspace=”100”></img>
I have also learned about its basic software such as MS Word, MS Powerpoint, MS Excel, and much more.<sup>14</sup>
All of my Computer teachers recognized me as one of the smartest around using computers.<sup>15</sup>
During those days up to grade 12, I’ve gained so much amazing experiences.<sup>16</sup> 
It may not be the same as when I was a kid, but experiencing something new gives you more knowledge of what the world can give you.<sup>17</sup>
I have met so many friends, and I have learned so much about how to use computers.<sup>18</sup>
Because of that I wanted to take the course of Information Technology.<sup>19</sup>
Technology is very helpful to all of us because it makes our lives easier and to accomplish something much quicker than going to a library.<sup>20</sup>

<h2>~<u><a id="college">College Years</a></u>~</h2>
<p align="justify"><sub><b>As I graduated high school, I went to 2 Universities 
<img src="COLLEGE DIEGO 1.png" class=imgl align="left" vspace=”100” vspace=”100”></img> 
to enroll and take an entrance exam.<sup>1</sup>
First was the FEU Tech, and then the University of the East.<sup>2</sup>
I have passed both of these tests and I must decide to which I should enroll to.<sup>3</sup>
I chose University of the East because a friend told me that the professors who teach computers are very amazing.<sup>4</sup>
Another reason is that UE’s BSIT tuition is much cheaper than FEU Tech.<sup>5</sup>
As I register in UE Manila, I admire the atmosphere of what college is like.<sup>6</sup>
Everyone is friendly and there are not much conflicts happening.<sup>7</sup>
The only struggle now that I must face is my studies.<sup>8</sup>
At my first day of class, I met new friends.<sup>9</sup>
<img src="COLLEGE DIEGO 3.png" class=imgr align="right" vspace=”100” vspace=”100”></img> 
The professors were a bit late during the first day of college classes.<sup>10</sup>
There were even a couple who did not attend at all.<sup>11</sup>
Other students said that it is normal that this happens.<sup>12</sup>
A we met the professors, we get along each other well.<sup>13</sup>
This was too good to be true.<sup>14</sup>
The professors are nice, and there is no single conflict that I experienced within the first year.<sup>15</sup>
The only thing that I should be focusing is all the lessons and activities that I should acquire.<sup>16</sup>
One thing I would also like to mention is that we can go outside now without surrendering our ID during breaks.<sup>17</sup>
The college life was perfect.<sup>18</sup>
The tests where hard and I had to do an all-nighter to study all of the lessons that they taught us.<sup>19</sup>
I have finally accomplished the first year of my college life and it was amazing.<sup>20</sup>
I have finally learned how to manage my time by myself, to do tasks that I wanted to learn, 
<img src="COLLEGE DIEGO 2.png" class=imgl align="left" vspace=”100” vspace=”100”></img> 
and to meet friends that I can communicate through physical meetings or even through the internet.<sup>21</sup>

This leads us today, where pandemic affected many schools.<sup>22</sup>
We have a vacation for 6 months, until online classes were born.<sup>23</sup>
It’s a struggle at first, but the cons are I don’t have to commute every single morning.<sup>24</sup>
But listening while just seated is a bit boring than the usual face-to-face teachings.<sup>25</sup>
If there is a cure, I would finally have the courage to go outside and finally enjoy going to places.<sup>26</sup>
My life as of today is going well, It is nice to talk about the past, what I have to worry right now is how to shape what my future would be.<sup>27</sup>
